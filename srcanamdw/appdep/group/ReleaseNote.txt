RELEASE NOTE FOR APPDEP, 2.2
========================================================================

Product Description:
====================
AppDep is a command line tool that can be used to resolve static
dependency information of a component within a Symbian OS build (either
platform or custom). The tool generates a cache file by reading the data
from all binaries and import libraries within a release, by using an
external compiler tool set. The use of a cache file is a fast way to make
a dependency review, such as what dependencies a binary has, and functions
and ordinals used in a binary, and to generate dependency lists to a
component or a function. The tool can also be used to view the properties
of a binary.

Features:
=========
- Generates a cache file appdep-cache-symbol-tables.txt which contain
  symbol tables of all import libraries within a release
- Generates a cache file appdep-cache-dependencies.txt which contain
  dependency information of all binaries within a release
- Reading data from AppDep generated cache files or from platform
  generated StaticDependencies.txt
- Include SIS files under analysis  
- Support for defining multiple target types
- Support for reading binaries from a release or a debug build
- Support for reading .lib files or .dso files
- Display properties of a file
- Print all static dependencies of a component
- Print all components that depends on a component
- Print all functions used by a component
- Print all components that are using a function

Fixed issues:
=============
- Added support for components that include "-" character in the middle of the component name i.e. now 
  also imported function lines of format '27 imports from libdbus-utils{000a0000}[20010154].dll' are parsed
  correctly from dump created by elftran.exe.
- Fixed issue 'command '-showfunctions' may report functions with same ordinal twice' which was due to duplicate
  import function instances found from cache file. Now the possible duplicate import function instances are detected
  during cache creation and only one import function instance is stored.
   
Enhancements:
=============
- Appdep now scans *.agt and *.fxt files as binaries
- Changed tool to use elftran.exe instead petran.exe for GCCE and RVCT toolchains (petran.exe is still used for GCC).

New Features:
=============

System Requirements:
====================
Basic Requirements:
- Windows 2000
- External RVCT or GCCE tool chain installed when Symbian OS 9.x is
  being used
- Symbian OS development environment installed including all related
  import libraries (.lib or .dso)

Compatibility Issues:
=====================
N/A

Known Issues:
=============

RVCT toolset slowness
---------------------
- If your installed RVCT toolset does not have a fixed license, it will
  get a license for each import library every time. This may cause the
  cache generation become very slow. If this is causing problems, try
  --uselibs parameter or use GCCE tool chain instead.
  
C++filt location when RVCT toolchain is used
--------------------------------------------
- When you RVCT toolchain, you must also specify a location to C++filt
  tool since RVCT toolchain does not provide that. It is recommended to
  use the cfilt.exe provided with AppDep installed since it has been
  tested to work correctly. C++filt.exe provided by the platform cannot
  be used since it is not compatible.
