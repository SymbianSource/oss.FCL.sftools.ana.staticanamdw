AppDep building instructions
============================

Windows platform
----------------

1) Set up MinGW and MSYS compiling environments
   - Download MinGW installer 5.0.2 (or newer) from http://www.mingw.org
   - Install MinGW including GCC compiler with version number at least 3.4.2
   - Download and install MSYS environment from http://www.mingw.org with
     version number at least 1.0.11
   - Set "bin"-directories of both MinGW and MSYS to your path environment, eg
        SET PATH=C:\APPS\MinGW\bin;C:\APPS\MSYS\bin;%PATH%  

2) Download Boost v1.33.1 from http://www.boost.org or directly from
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586. Install it to any
   folder

3) Modify "BOOSTHOME"-variable in a file "group/MakeFile" in AppDep installation to
   point to the directory where you installed Boost.
   
4) With command prompt, go to the same "group" directory and type "make". 



Any other platform
------------------

Set up GCC compiling environment as usually and follow steps 2-4 just like in the
instructions for Windows platform.
